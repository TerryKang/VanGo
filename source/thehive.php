		The Hive is Vancouver's Bouldering Gym. It is the response to a great need seen within Vancouver: the need for a climbing space that supports the vibrant climbing community in the lower mainland.
		The Hive is also a response to the longstanding need for a climbing gym dedicated to the fantastic pursuit of bouldering; arguably, both the best way to learn and to advance in climbing at any level: beginner, intermediate, or advanced.
		The Hive is more than your average Indoor Climbing Gym. It is a place to hang out, meet others, listen to great music, and climb till your heart's content. We host a lively and active social scene, made up of a community of caring and considerate climbers, sharing stories and successes, supporting each other and celebrating climbing together.
