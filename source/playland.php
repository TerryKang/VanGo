		One of the most popular attractions at the PNE site is Playland Amusement Park, the 15-acre amusement park (open from April through October) has hosted millions of thrillseekers of all ages since it opened in 1910. 
		The Park was named "Happy Land" in 1926 and remained on the original site until 1958, when it was moved to its present site and re-opened under the name, Playland. Previously owned by a number of parent companies, Playland became a division of the Pacific National Exhibition family in July, 1993.
		Playland's marquee attraction, the beloved 1958 Wooden Roller Coaster remains the most popular ride on the site and one of the most highly regarded wooden coasters in the world. Designed by the legendary ride construction team, Carl Phare and Walker LeRoy, the Playland Wooden Coaster rides over half a million thrillseekers annually.
